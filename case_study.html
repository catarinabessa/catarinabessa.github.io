                the role of a police officer in games is often portrayed
                negatively. But what if there was a game about an honest
                police
                officer? what if he was dealing with family issues because
                of
                being a “hostage” to his job?<br>
                few cases in this medium explore the dangers in a police
                officer's life and their mental and physical consequences.
                what
                would be the impact of a tragic night on a police officer's
                mind?<br>
                what if the police officer
                was part of the lgbtqia+ community? how would that affect
                his
                life and his relationships with colleagues, both on and off
                duty?<br>
                all these questions, and many more, gave life to this
                project:
                an interactive narrative game about a gay police officer
                going
                through a hellish night with his husband and daughter. the
                player's choices will determine the protagonist's and his
                family's fate.<br>
                this project englobes homophobic themes in the workplace;
                being
                a hostage of their own job and how that affects their
                relationships; and the consequences that the dangerous job
                of
                being a policeman bring to the mind.

                                    as quick-time events scattered throughout the game, which

                                    in undertale, each character has a unique sound—a pattern

                                    personality. whenever the player interacts with the
                                    inhabitants of the underground, these sounds can be heard,
                                    varying in rhythm, tone, and duration. this sound design
                                    choice was crucial in shaping the audio profile of the

                                    similar to bloomtown: a different story, anniversary night uses a black background
                                    to surround the environments, focusing the player's attention on the main action.
                                    this reduces distractions from excessive assets or animations and prevents the
                                    player from being overwhelmed by overly detailed surroundings. additionally, instead
                                    of using a text box at the bottom of the screen for character dialogue, anniversary
                                    night features speech bubbles above the speaking character. unlike text boxes, which
                                    can obscure animations and take up nearly half the screen, speech bubbles are less
                                    intrusive and feel more natural.

                anniversary night is an interactive narrative game where the
                player assumes the role of paul, a gay
                police officer facing homophobia at work.<br> the game
                starts abruptly, immersing the player directly into a

                    in total, 5 scripts in c# were
                    created.
                    these were the following: the main
                    menu, the settings menu,
                    the controller, the choices script
                    and the text script.<br> <br>
                    the original sounds were all created
                    on audacity while the rest,
                    were reappropriations of sounds
                    already existent that then suffered
                    alterations.<br>the combination of
                    realistic sounds and stylized
                    dialogue creates an interesting
                    auditory experience due to its
                    contrast.
                    on one hand, immersion and realism
                    are present in the atmospheric sound
                    design; on the other, the
                    characters' “beeps” and “boops” add
                    a more
                    playful aspect to the audio
                    experience. this enhances the
                    gameplay and
                    enriches the player's overall
                    experience.

                throughout the development of this
                project, we deepened our understanding
                of the topics we
                initially
                aimed
                to address, thanks to extensive research
                and investigation.<br>
                the real-life experiences of gay
                individuals helped us grasp the nature
                of discrimination, both
                past
                and
                present, in workplaces and daily life.
                we also came to better understand the
                various
                consequences of
                being a
                police officer, from the dangers and
                stress inherent to the profession to the
                impacts on mental
                health
                and
                the concerns for their loved ones.<br>
                this work provided a positive
                experience, fostering group unity and
                offering new learning
                opportunities
                for
                each member, ranging from programming
                (as no group member had prior
                programming knowledge) to
                the
                creation
                and animation of pixel art.<br>
                the main objectives of the game were
                achieved satisfactorily. although the
                game itself was not
                fully
                completed, we would like to continue its
                development in the future.
