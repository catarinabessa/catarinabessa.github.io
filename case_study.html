                in anniversary night, the player assumes the paper of paul, a
                gay cop who struggles with derogatory comments and threats in
                his workplace.<br>
                in this day, it is paul and his husband's anniversary but
                unfortunately this night doesn't go as it should: the couple and
                their daughter go through an awful and unexpected ordeal and
                it's up to the player to make what they deem the right choices.

            <h1>problem and objective</h1>
            the role of a police officer in games is often portrayed
            negatively. But what if there was a game about an honest police
            officer? what if he was dealing with family issues because of
            being a “hostage” to his job?<br>
            few cases in this medium explore the dangers in a police
            officer's life and their mental and physical consequences. what
            would be the impact of a tragic night on a police officer's
            mind?<br>
            currently, there are many games where the main character is part
            of the lgbtqia+ community; however, they often focus on a
            teenager questioning, "who am i?". what if the police officer
            was part of the lgbtqia+ community? how would that affect his
            life and his relationships with colleagues, both on and off
            duty?<br>
            all these questions, and many more, gave life to this project:
            an interactive narrative game about a gay police officer going
            through a hellish night with his husband and daughter. the
            player's choices will determine the protagonist's and his
            family's fate.<br>
            this project englobes homophobic themes in the workplace; being
            a hostage of their own job and how that affects their
            relationships; and the consequences that the dangerous job of
            being a policeman bring to the mind. continuous and intensive
            investigation about these topics were made in order to craft a
            realistic and compelling story as well as a relatable
            protagonist.

                brooklyn nine-nine is an american comedy series. the story
                follows seven nypd (new york police department) detectives and
                their commander, raymond holt.<br>
                in the series, raymond is portrayed as the nypd's first black
                and openly gay police commander. because of these realities,
                raymond faced discrimination and marginalization in his field,
                especially when he began his career in the 1980s.<br>
                it was a constant struggle to be taken seriously, and he spent
                years without being promoted, despite being the most competent
                officer among his peers.

                    this game serves as the foundation for the gameplay of
                    anniversary night. much of the gameplay revolves around
                    multiple choices that shape the story's progression, as well
                    as quick-time events scattered throughout the game, which
                    can also determine whether the character the player is
                    controlling at the moment survives or dies.<br>
                    to create a higher level of tension, both until dawn and
                    anniversary night incorporate timers for choices and
                    quick-time events. these elements make the game more
                    unsettling and realistic. players must make rapid decisions
                    that steer the story in completely different directions.

                    in undertale, each character has a unique sound—a pattern
                    made up of “beeps” and “boops” that reflect their
                    personality. whenever the player interacts with the
                    inhabitants of the underground, these sounds can be heard,
                    varying in rhythm, tone, and duration. this sound design

                    similar to bloomtown: a different story, anniversary night
                    uses a black background to surround the environments,

                    approach reduces distractions from excessive assets or

                    overly detailed surroundings.<br>
                    additionally, instead of using a text box at the bottom of
                    the screen for character dialogue, anniversary night
                    features speech bubbles appearing above the speaking
                    character. unlike text boxes, which could obscure animations
                    and take up nearly half the screen, speech bubbles are far
                    less intrusive and feel more natural.

                    important reference in developing the characters for

                <h1>game concept</h1>
                anniversary night is an interactive narrative game where the
                player assumes the role of paul, a gay police officer who faces
                homophobic comments and insults at work. <br>
                no formal introduction is provided. as soon as the game begins,
                the player is "dropped" directly into a homophobic conversation
                between two police officers about the character they control.
                this approach aims to enhance the immersion in the protagonist's
                world, making the player forget they are playing a video
                game.<br>
                using a black screen with an introduction explaining the
                character, their family relationships, and workplace struggles
                could break this immersion, preventing the player from fully
                inhabiting the world as if they were the protagonist
                themselves.<br>
                throughout the story, the player will make various choices that
                affect the protagonist's career, family relationships, and the
                lives of all three family members.<br>
                during these moments, a timer will be implemented to increase
                the pressure of decision-making and create tension. the player
                is forced to react quickly, without overthinking. this mechanic
                makes these pivotal moments feel closer to real-life scenarios.
                for instance, if someone points a gun at another person,
                threatening to shoot, there are only seconds to act before it's
                too late.<br>
                as the story progresses, the player will gain insight into how
                homophobia remains pervasive in the 21st century, especially in
                police departments, as well as the risks and deeply negative
                psychological consequences of such a career.<br>
                by the end, the player will see how their actions impacted the
                different members of the family. learning how their decisions
                influenced each character's life is meant to weigh on the
                player's conscience, motivating them to try their luck and play
                again.

            <h1>conclusion</h1>
            throughout the development of this project, we deepened our understanding of the topics we initially aimed to address, thanks to extensive research and investigation.<br>
            the real-life experiences of gay individuals helped us grasp the nature of discrimination, both past and present, in workplaces and daily life. we also came to better understand the various consequences of being a police officer, from the dangers and stress inherent to the profession to the impacts on mental health and the concerns for their loved ones.<br>
            this work provided a positive experience, fostering group unity and offering new learning opportunities for each member, ranging from programming (as no group member had prior programming knowledge) to the creation and animation of pixel art.<br>
            the main objectives of the game were achieved satisfactorily. although the game itself was not fully completed, we would like to continue its development in the future.
