            showing its consequences in one's life.

                the role of a police officer in games is often portrayed
                negatively and few cases in this medium explore the mental and physical consequences of being one on
                one's life. <br><br>but what if there was a game about an
                honest
                police
                officer? <br>what if he was dealing with family issues because
                of
                being a “hostage” to his job?<br>
                what
                would be the impact of a tragic night on a police officer's
                mind?<br>
                what if the police officer
                was part of the lgbtqia+ community? <br> how would that affect
                his
                life and his relationships with colleagues, both on and off
                duty?<br><br>
                all these questions, and many more, gave life to this
                project:
                an interactive narrative game about a gay police officer
                going
                through a hellish night with his husband and daughter. the
                player's choices will determine the protagonist's and his
                family's fate.<br>
                this project englobes homophobic themes in the workplace;
                being
                a hostage of their own job and how that affects their
                relationships; and the consequences that the dangerous job
                of
                being a policeman bring to the mind.

                anniversary night is an interactive narrative game where the
                player assumes the role of paul, a gay
                police officer facing homophobia at work.<br><br> the game
                starts abruptly, immersing the player directly into a
                homophobic conversation between colleagues to enhance
                realism and empathy, avoiding formal introductions
                that might break immersion.<br>
                the player makes choices that impact paul's career,
                relationships, and the lives of his three
                family members.a timer is used during critical moments
                to add tension, forcing quick decisions that
                simulate real-life pressure, such as responding to
                life-or-death scenarios.
                as the story unfolds, the game explores the persistence
                of homophobia in modern police departments and
                its severe psychological consequences. by the end, the
                player witnesses how their decisions shaped the
                family's outcomes, encouraging replayability to reflect on
                and alter the story's course.

                flowchart served as a visual guide, ensuring that all narrative branches and their outcomes were clearly

                    in total, 5 scripts in c# were
                    created.
                    these were the following: the main
                    menu, the settings menu,
                    the controller, the choices script
                    and the text script.<br> <br>
                    the original sounds were all created
                    on audacity while the rest,
                    were reappropriations of sounds
                    already existent that then suffered
                    alterations.<br>the combination of
                    realistic sounds and stylized
                    dialogue creates an interesting
                    auditory experience due to its
                    contrast.
                    on one hand, immersion and realism
                    are present in the atmospheric sound
                    design; on the other, the
                    characters' “beeps” and “boops” add
                    a more
                    playful aspect to the audio
                    experience. this enhances the
                    gameplay and
                    enriches the player's overall
                    experience.

                throughout the development of this
                project, we deepened our understanding
                of the topics we
                initially
                aimed
                to address, thanks to extensive research
                and investigation.<br>
                the real-life experiences of gay
                individuals helped us grasp the nature
                of discrimination, both
                past
                and
                present, in workplaces and daily life.
                we also came to better understand the
                various
                consequences of
                being a
                police officer, from the dangers and
                stress inherent to the profession to the
                impacts on mental
                health
                and
                the concerns for their loved ones.<br><br>
                this work provided a positive
                experience, fostering group unity and
                offering new learning
                opportunities
                for
                each member, ranging from programming to
                the
                creation
                and animation of pixel art.<br>
                the main objectives of the game were
                achieved satisfactorily. although the
                game itself was not
                fully
                completed, we would like to continue its
                development in the future.
